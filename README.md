# Description

<!-- Some wording taken from instructions readme -->

An application that allows the user to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online. This app gives users a fast and easy way to track their money and allows them to access that information anytime.
